  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello! My name is Gabriel Barreto, and I'm a beginner web developer based in Portugal. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and building real-world projects.</p>

  <p>I started programming because I love solving problems and creating useful tools. Right now, I'm focused on learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python to become a professional developer.</p>

  <p>Every day I practice coding and work on improving my portfolio. My goal is to get a job in tech, grow my skills, and work on exciting projects in Europe.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
